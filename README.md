# GroceryTrackerApp
This software allows for the input of a grocery list which allows for easier tracking. It utilitizes both C++ and Python for its main functions.
It counts the amount of occurences of one item in the inputted list. This list can also be displayed with a histogram allowing for better visuals.

One way that the code could be improved would be the ability to locate a certain text file for input as it currently relies on it to be under a certain name and directory.

The part that challenged me the most was the histogram. I used a loop to repeat '-' based on the amount of occurences which required a little bit of googling to refresh.

I believe the usage of multiple programming languages will be used for the rest of my career. I'm excited to see what the future holds for this.

As far as keeping the program readable I left in line comments to explain what certain functions did. I also tried to keep naming conventions as simple and readable as possible.
